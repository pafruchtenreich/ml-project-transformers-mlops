# Transformer Exploration for News Summarization :newspaper:

This project explores Transformer-based models inspired by the paper [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). We compare three approaches for **news article summarization** using the [Kaggle News Summarization dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/news-summarization):

1. :repeat: A **traditional RNN encoder-decoder** model  
2. :zap: A **Transformer** model (as in *Attention Is All You Need*)  
3. :rocket: A **pre-trained BERT** model (fine-tuned for summarization)

## How to use the code

The code for this project is available in a modular format. All utility functions are organized into `.py` files, while a Jupyter notebook (`TextSummarization.ipynb`) orchestrates their execution. 

Here’s how you can explore the repository:

1. **Run all cells** :hourglass_flowing_sand:: Fully reproduce the entire workflow!  
   - Note: This requires significant computational resources and time for training.

2. **Use the Transformer weights** :mechanical_arm::  
   - The folder `model_weights/` contains checkpoints for the Transformer model. You can use these to generate summaries without retraining.

3. **Examine generated summaries** :page_facing_up::  
   - The folder `model_predictions/` holds sample outputs generated by the Transformer model.

## Results and Experiments

The models were trained on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40 GB of high-bandwidth memory :computer:

| Model                        | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | Train Time (ep)  | Params  |
|------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|---------|
| RNN Encoder-Decoder          | 0.08    | 0.00    | 0.08    | ~ $7.5 \times 10^4$ s (25) | $1.19 \times 10^7$  |
| Transformer                  | 0.20    | 0.04    | 0.15    | ~ $1.6 \times 10^4$ s (25) | $1.25 \times 10^7$  |
| BERT                         | 0.13    | 0.01    | 0.10    | ~ $7.7 \times 10^4$ s (7) | $1.33 \times 10^8$  |
